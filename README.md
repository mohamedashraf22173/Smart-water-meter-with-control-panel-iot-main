In light of the increasing scarcity of fresh water resources and the increasing need to rationalize its consumption, the water meter project offers an innovative solution for managing water efficiently and effectively. The project provides a smart system for measuring water consumption, integrated with an advanced control panel that allows full control of all meters, with the ability to monitor consumption remotely.
Project features:
• High measurement accuracy: The system guarantees water consumption measurement accuracy of up to 98%, allowing for accurate readings and fair billing.
• Monitoring consumption: The system allows monitoring of water consumption in real time on a digital screen, and also sends warning messages to the customer when the specified amount of water is about to expire.
• Integrated management system: Through the system, all meters can be fully controlled, as the consumption of all rooms or apartments is displayed on an admin control panel.
• Complete control: The system enables you to lock and unlock the water for the customer and specify a specific amount of water for the customer, and when consumed, the water is automatically cut off.
• Imposing fees: You can impose the necessary fees on the customer, such as cleaning or maintenance fees, or any other fees specific to the place.
• Data analysis: The system provides a complete analysis tool for customer data and consumption by day, month, and years.
• Cheap price: The price of the device is very cheap compared to the price of ordinary mechanical meters, taking into account its capabilities, features, and high accuracy.
• UPS System: The system is equipped with a UPS system to operate for 15 days to 40 days without electricity in the event of a power outage.
Comparison with mechanical meters:
• Higher accuracy: The system provides measurement accuracy of up to 98%, while the accuracy of mechanical meters does not exceed 80%.
• Complete control: The system allows full control of all meters remotely, while the functions of mechanical meters are limited to measuring consumption only.
• Data analysis: The system provides a complete analysis tool for consumption data, while this feature is not available in mechanical meters.
• Higher efficiency: The system contributes to rationalizing water consumption, which leads to saving money.
Proven experience:
The smart water management system has been installed in many places and tested for long periods, and has proven its efficiency through multiple experiments.
